In the context of the previous HTML code snippet shared, the form did not specify allowed file types explicitly, suggesting it might accept any file type by default, but this is a common security misconfiguration and not a definitive conclusion. In a real scenario, you'd look for attributes like `accept` in the `<input>` tag or server-side restrictions.", 'gif', False]
