["The injection point of SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) is typically in the user-controllable input fields that are used to render dynamic content on the server-side. In the context of the provided information, it was suggested to consider manipulation through the XFF (X-Forwarded-For) header, but the actual injection point would depend on how the application processes this header or any other user inputs within the Smarty template engine. Without specific vulnerability details, the exact field can't be pinpointed, but in general, SSTI occurs in form inputs, query parameters, or any data that gets embedded directly into template code.", 'X-Forwarded-For', True]

["Based on the provided information, it's not explicitly clear which field or area on the page acts as the echo point for SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection). The question seems to be seeking a specific element or input within the webpage that could reflect injected template code. However, without specific vulnerability indicators or interactive feedback, a definitive answer isn't possible. The potential for SSTI was inferred from the hint but not concretely identified in the response content.", 'Current IP', False]
