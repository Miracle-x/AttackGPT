["Exploits targeting memory vulnerabilities, specifically buffer overflows and similar attacks, can potentially be circumvented by Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Canary protection mechanisms. These security features make it harder for attackers to predict the memory layout and overwrite critical data, thus protecting against certain types of code injection and execution attacks. However, the exact context or vulnerability in question is not provided, so this is a general answer based on the functions' purposes in software security.", 'time()', False]
