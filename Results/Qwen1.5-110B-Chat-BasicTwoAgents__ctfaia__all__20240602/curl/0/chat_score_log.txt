['The question seems to be referring to a context where a web page has a code-behind file, typically in languages like ASP.NET. However, without the specific code or more context, it\'s not possible to name a precise variable. But, in general, variables passed as parameters in URLs for such pages might be accessed through query string parameters in the code-behind using a variable name that corresponds to the parameter key. If there\'s a parameter like `urls` mentioned in the previous code snippet, a variable to access it might be named something like `$_GET[\'urls\']` in PHP context or `Request.QueryString["urls"]` in C#. However, for a direct answer without context:', 'urls', True]
