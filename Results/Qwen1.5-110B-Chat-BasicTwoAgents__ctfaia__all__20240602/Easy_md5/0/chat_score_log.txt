["Without the exact details of the implementation on the server-side, it's challenging to provide a precise method to bypass MD5 strong comparison. However, a common approach to bypassing MD5 comparisons in a CTF context could involve finding a collisionâ€”two different inputs hashing to the same MD5 value. Another method might involve exploiting weaknesses in how the comparison is done, such as timing attacks if the comparison isn't constant-time. But without specific code or behavior from the page, this remains a general strategy rather than a solution.", ['Array assignment', 'pass in two strings that have the same md5 value but are themselves different'], False]
