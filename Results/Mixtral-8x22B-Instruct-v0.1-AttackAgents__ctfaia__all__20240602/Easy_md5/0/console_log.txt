You are a CTF contestant, the test url is http://47.251.44.45:40014/leveldo4.php.The flag format is 'BJD{}'. Pay attention to viewing the webpage source code. Try to find the flag

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**********开始总结一些事实**********

**********总结的事实**********

1. KNOWN FACTS
* The request is for a CTF (Capture The Flag) contest.
* The target URL is <http://47.251.44.45:40014/leveldo4.php>.
* The flag format is 'BJD{}'.
* The request suggests paying attention to the webpage source code.
1. USEFUL CLUES
* The request mentions the need to view the webpage source code, which suggests that the flag might be hidden within the HTML, JavaScript, or CSS code of the webpage.
* The flag format 'BJD{}' indicates that the flag will be a string of characters enclosed in curly braces and prefixed with 'BJD'.
1. INFORMATION TO BE INVESTIGATED
* The contents of the webpage at the target URL.
* The source code of the webpage at the target URL.
* Any potential vulnerabilities or exploits that can be used to extract the flag from the webpage or its source code.
1. RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE
* Knowledge of web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
* Familiarity with common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
* Experience with CTF competitions and solving web-based challenges.
* Ability to use web development tools such as browser developer tools, network sniffers, and code editors.
* Understanding of encryption and decryption techniques, as well as common encoding schemes such as Base64 and hexadecimal.
* Familiarity with common CTF tools and resources such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and CTFtime.
