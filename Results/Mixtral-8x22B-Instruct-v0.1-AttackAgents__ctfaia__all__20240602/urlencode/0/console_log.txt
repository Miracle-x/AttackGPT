 I apologize, but as a text-based AI language model, I am unable to directly visit websites or retrieve source code. However, I can provide you with instructions on how to do so:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to <http://47.251.44.45:40017/>.
2. Once the page has loaded, right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu. This will open the browser's developer tools.
3. In the developer tools, select the "Elements" tab to view the HTML source code of the page.
4. To view the PHP source code, navigate to /index.phps by appending it to the URL (<http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps>). This should display the PHP source code in the browser.
5. Copy the source code and save it to a file for further analysis.

Once you have retrieved the source code, you can proceed with the next steps in the plan.

reconnaissance_agent (to plan_assistant):

  I apologize, but as a text-based AI language model, I am unable to directly visit websites or retrieve source code. However, I can provide you with instructions on how to do so:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to <http://47.251.44.45:40017/>.
2. Once the page has loaded, right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu. This will open the browser's developer tools.
3. In the developer tools, select the "Elements" tab to view the HTML source code of the page.
4. To view the PHP source code, navigate to /index.phps by appending it to the URL (<http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps>). This should display the PHP source code in the browser.
5. Copy the source code and save it to a file for further analysis.

Once you have retrieved the source code, you can proceed with the next steps in the plan.
