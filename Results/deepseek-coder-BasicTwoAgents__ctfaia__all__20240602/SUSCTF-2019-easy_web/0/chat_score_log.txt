["The content in the 'img' tag has been base64 encoded zero times, as the 'src' attribute of the 'img' tag is set to 'data:image/gif;base64,' which is not followed by any base64 encoded data. The base64 encoding is typically used to encode binary data into a format that can be safely included in text-based formats like HTML. If the 'src' attribute contained a base64 encoded string, it would look something like 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs='.", '2', False]

["The parameters 'a' and 'b' are typically passed in through the URL of a GET request. In a GET request, parameters are appended to the URL after a question mark (?), with each parameter separated by an ampersand (&). For example, if the URL is http://example.com/script.php, and 'a' is 1 and 'b' is 2, the parameters would be passed like this: http://example.com/script.php?a=1&b=2.", 'POST', False]
