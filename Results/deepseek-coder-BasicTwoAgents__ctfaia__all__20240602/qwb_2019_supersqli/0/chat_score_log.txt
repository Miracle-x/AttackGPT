['The keywords that are filtered in the database query are typically SQL injection protection mechanisms. These mechanisms include using parameterized queries or prepared statements, which ensure that user input is treated as data and not as part of the query structure. This prevents an attacker from manipulating the query to execute unwanted commands. Additionally, input validation and output encoding are also used to prevent SQL injection attacks.', ['select', 'update', 'delete', 'drop', 'insert', 'where'], False]
