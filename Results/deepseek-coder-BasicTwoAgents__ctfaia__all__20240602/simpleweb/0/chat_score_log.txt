If you want to generate the pseudo-random number 703 with a specific seed, you would use `srand($seed);` where `$seed` is the value you want to use as the seed. However, without knowing the specific seed used to generate the pseudo-random number 703, it's not possible to determine the seed value.", '343147682', False]
