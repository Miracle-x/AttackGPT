['One possible method to bypass md5 strong comparison under this page is to use a timing attack. In a timing attack, an attacker sends crafted inputs to the server and measures the time it takes for the server to respond. By analyzing the response times, the attacker can deduce information about the hashed value, such as the original string. This can potentially be used to bypass the md5 strong comparison by guessing the correct string that produces the desired hash.', ['Array assignment', 'pass in two strings that have the same md5 value but are themselves different'], False]
