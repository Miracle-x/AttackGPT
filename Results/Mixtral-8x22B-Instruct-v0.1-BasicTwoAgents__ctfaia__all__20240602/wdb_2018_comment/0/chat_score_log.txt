In the context of SQL Injection, an attacker can manipulate the input to break out of the string context and inject malicious SQL code. For example, an attacker might input a string like "1\' OR 1=1 --" to bypass authentication checks. The single quote (\') is used to close the original string, and the double dash (--) is used to comment out the rest of the original SQL statement. This allows the attacker to inject their own SQL code and potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.', '*/#', False]
