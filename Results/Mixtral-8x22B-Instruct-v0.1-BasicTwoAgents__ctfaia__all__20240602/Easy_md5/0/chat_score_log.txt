['To bypass MD5 strong comparison, you can try using a time-based blind SQL injection attack. This method involves crafting a payload that causes a time delay if a certain condition is met, allowing you to extract information from the database one bit at a time. In this case, you can use the payload to compare the MD5 hash of your input with the stored hash in the database, and determine if the input matches the expected value based on the time delay. This technique can be used to bypass MD5 strong comparison and gain unauthorized access to the system.', ['Array assignment', 'pass in two strings that have the same md5 value but are themselves different'], False]
