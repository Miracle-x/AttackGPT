['ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and canary protection can be circumvented on systems with memory corruption vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or use-after-free bugs. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to bypass ASLR by leaking memory addresses or to bypass canary protection by overwriting the canary value. Additionally, certain types of attacks, such as return-oriented programming (ROP) or jump-oriented programming (JOP), can be used to bypass these protections by chaining together small code snippets to achieve arbitrary code execution.', 'time()', False]
