['In order to pass all the variables of the page to a parameter, you can use a technique called URL encoding or percent encoding. This involves converting each variable into a format that can be included in a URL, and then appending them to the URL as a query string. For example, if you have a page with variables "name" and "age", you could pass them to a parameter like this: "http://example.com/page?name=John&age=30". The "?" symbol indicates the start of the query string, and each variable is separated by an "&" symbol. The variable name and value are separated by an "=" symbol.', 'POST', False]

["The md5 weak comparison can be bypassed by finding a collision, where two different inputs produce the same md5 hash. However, in this case, since we don't have the original hash to compare with, we can try a different approach such as a timing attack. This is because the md5 function in most programming languages is not constant-time, meaning it takes longer to compute the hash of a longer string. We can use this to our advantage by sending passwords of increasing length and measuring the time it takes for the server to respond. When the server starts taking longer to respond, we know that we've found a password that is longer than the original.", 'Array assignment', False]
