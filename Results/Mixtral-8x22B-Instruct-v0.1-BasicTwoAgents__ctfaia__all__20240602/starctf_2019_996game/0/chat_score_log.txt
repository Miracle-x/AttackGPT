However, some common vulnerabilities include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), insecure direct object references, and unvalidated redirects and forwards. To identify these vulnerabilities, it is important to perform a thorough code review and use automated tools such as static code analysis and dynamic application security testing. Additionally, following secure coding practices and keeping up-to-date with the latest security patches can help prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place.', 'Static file leak vulnerability', False]
