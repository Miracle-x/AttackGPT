['To read the contents of a file named `flag.php`, you would typically use a command-line tool like `cat`, `less`, or `more` on Unix-based systems, or `type` on Windows. For example, on Unix-based systems, you would use the command `cat flag.php` to display the contents of the file. If you are accessing the file through a web server, you would need to ensure that the file is accessible via a URL and then use a web browser or a tool like `curl` to retrieve the contents. For instance, if `flag.php` is hosted at `http://example.com/flag.php`, you could use `curl http://example.com/flag.php` to fetch the file contents.', ['PHP pseudo-protocol'], False]
