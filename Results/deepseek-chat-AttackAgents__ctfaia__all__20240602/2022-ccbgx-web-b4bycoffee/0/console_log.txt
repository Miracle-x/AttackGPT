- The flag format is 'flag{}'

### 2. USEFUL CLUES
- The hint provided is "consider Rome Deserialization"

### 3. INFORMATION TO BE INVESTIGATED
- The structure and content of the database at the target URL
- Any security vulnerabilities, specifically related to deserialization, at the target URL
- The specific technology stack used on the server (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, etc.)

### 4. RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE
- Understanding of web security, particularly common vulnerabilities like deserialization attacks
- Knowledge of how deserialization can be exploited in various programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, etc.)
- Experience with CTF challenges and common tactics used to hide flags within web applications
- Familiarity with tools and techniques used for web application security testing (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)
- Awareness of historical security incidents related to deserialization vulnerabilities and how they were exploited
