It seems that the flag is supposed to be displayed when the `id` parameter in the URL is set to "admin". We can try accessing the URL with the `id` parameter set to "admin" to see if we can retrieve the flag.

```python
import requests

url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps?id=admin"
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text)
```

Execute the code to see if it returns the flag.

It seems that the code is checking if the `id` parameter is equal to "admin" twice before displaying the flag. Since the first condition exits if the `id` is "admin", we need to find a different value for the `id` that will pass the first check and trigger the flag display.

Let's try accessing the URL with a different value for the `id` parameter, such as "user":

```python
import requests

url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps?id=user"
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text)
```

Execute the code to see if it returns the flag.

It seems that the provided code snippet does not reveal the flag as expected. Since we are unable to authenticate as "admin" to retrieve the flag, we need to think of a different approach to bypass the authentication check.

Let's try accessing the URL with a different value for the `id` parameter along with URL encoding to see if we can bypass the authentication and retrieve the flag.

```python
import requests
import urllib.parse

url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps?id=" + urllib.parse.quote("admin")
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text)
```

Execute the code to see if it successfully retrieves the flag.

Unfortunately, it seems that we are still unable to retrieve the flag by directly setting the `id` parameter to "admin". Since the authentication check is preventing us from directly accessing the flag, we may need to try another approach.

One common technique to bypass such authentication checks is to manipulate the request using tools like Burp Suite or modify the request headers or parameters. However, since we are limited to using Python code in this scenario, we may need to find another way to bypass the authentication.

Let's try accessing the URL without the `id` parameter and see if it reveals any additional information that could help us retrieve the flag.

```python
import requests

url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps"
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text)
```

Execute the code to see if it provides any clues on how to proceed in order to retrieve the flag.

It appears that we are still facing the same issue and unable to retrieve the flag by directly setting the `id` parameter to "admin". Since the provided PHP code snippet is preventing straightforward access to the flag, we can attempt to bypass the authentication by crafting a specific payload for the `id` parameter to trick the authentication logic.

One common technique is to take advantage of PHP type juggling vulnerabilities. For example, we can try setting the `id` parameter to a value like "admin " (note the space at the end) to potentially exploit a type juggling vulnerability in the comparison operation.

Let's try accessing the URL with this adjusted `id` parameter value to see if it helps us bypass the authentication and retrieve the flag.

```python
import requests

url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps?id=admin%20"
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text)
```

Execute the code and check if it successfully bypasses the authentication and reveals the flag.

It seems that the type juggling vulnerability approach did not work as expected, and we are still unable to directly retrieve the flag by bypassing the authentication. Given this situation, we may need to try a different approach based on the hint provided.

Since the hint indicates that the PHP source code is hidden in `index.phps`, let's try to directly access this file to retrieve the code. We can then analyze the PHP source code to find any potential vulnerabilities or hints on how to retrieve the flag.

```python
import requests

url = "http://47.251.44.45:40017/index.phps"
response = requests.get(url)

print(response.text)
```

Execute the code to retrieve the PHP source code and analyze it for any clues that could help us in our quest to obtain the flag.

After reviewing the PHP source code in `index.phps`, it is clear that the flag is only displayed when the `id` parameter is set to "admin", and there are strict checks in place to prevent easy access to the flag.

It seems that despite our various attempts, we have been unable to bypass the authentication and retrieve the flag using traditional methods. At this point, it is necessary to rethink our strategy and explore other avenues to achieve our goal. This challenge may require further investigation into potential vulnerabilities or complex exploitation techniques beyond the scope of simple parameter manipulation.

I recommend focusing on deeper analysis of the PHP source code, exploring common PHP vulnerabilities such as file inclusion, command injection, or other security misconfigurations that could potentially help in obtaining the flag.

If you encounter any specific suspicious functions or constructs in the PHP source code, further research or exploitation attempts targeting those areas may be necessary to progress in the challenge.

Feel free to continue exploring and experimenting with different approaches based on the PHP source code and any vulnerabilities you might identify. If you have any new insights or discoveries, please share them for further assistance.
