['We can use a timing attack to bypass the MD5 strong comparison under this page. Timing attacks exploit the fact that the time it takes to perform a cryptographic operation can reveal information about the secret key. In the context of an MD5 comparison, if the comparison is not constant-time, an attacker can measure the time it takes for the comparison to complete and use this information to deduce whether certain characters in the input are correct. By carefully crafting inputs and measuring the response time, an attacker can gradually reveal the correct MD5 hash.', ['Array assignment', 'pass in two strings that have the same md5 value but are themselves different'], False]
